# IO(WS)T

These are the different versions of code developed for an IoT device that senses water droplets from the leakage of water from taps and hence can send the data based on preset values. This was developed pre Covid-19 lockdowns. The hardware design will be uploaded shortly. This design uses a lowcost wifi-module named Air602 and thus the code reflects that. The code is written in Embedded C and the microcontroller used is a Renesas one.

This project was developed in regards to a competition whose final round was about to held during the March of 2020 (Talk about timing). The photo i am adding below has me participating in the prelims for this competition on 31st of Oct 2019.![75035313_2560395724038387_7562629954404352_n(Copy)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d56045-fe13-4019-903f-9fea4a19148e)
